## AI Assistance Disclosure

This project used the OpenAI API (GPT-4) to help enhance the bourbon dataset. Specifically, GPT-4 was used to:
- Generate missing flavor profiles for bourbons
- Estimate release years based on context clues
- Suggest mash bill breakdowns where data was missing

All AI-generated data was manually reviewed and cleaned before inclusion. No part of the R code, Shiny app design, or package structure was generated by AI.  
All programming, documentation, and deployment were done manually by Chris Reddish.
