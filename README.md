# 🥃 Bourbon Explorer (Shiny App)

An interactive Shiny app built in R for exploring the world of bourbon whiskey.  
Developed by **Chris Reddish**, this application allows users to filter, compare, and visualize bourbon attributes such as price, ABV, rating, mash bill, and flavor profile — all in a smooth, user-friendly interface.

🌐 **Live App**:

## 🚀 Features

- 🧪 Filter bourbons by Price, ABV, Year, Distillery, and more  
- 📊 Compare ratings and pricing with density plots and scatterplots  
- 🔍 Explore mash bill breakdowns and flavor profiles  
- 💡 Search for bourbons with similar profiles or high value-to-cost ratios  
- 🎯 Built in R with `shiny`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `plotly`  
- 🧠 GPT-assisted enrichment of incomplete dataset

## 📦 Installation (as R Package)

You can install the app as a package from GitHub using `devtools`:

```r
# First, install devtools if you haven't:
install.packages("devtools")

# Then install the bourbonExplorer package
devtools::install_github("your-github-username/bourbonExplorer")
```

Once installed, run the app locally:

```r
bourbonExplorer::run_app()
```

## 📊 Dataset Notes

This project uses a hand-curated dataset of bourbons scraped and enhanced with the help of GPT-4. The dataset includes:

- Brand name, Distillery, ABV, Price, Age/Year
- Flavor profile descriptors (e.g., vanilla, oak, caramel)
- Mash bill estimates (corn/rye/wheat/barley)
- Community ratings

## 🤖 AI Assistance Disclosure

This project used OpenAI’s GPT-4 API to enrich data in the following ways:

- Generated missing **flavor profiles** for bourbons with limited metadata
- Estimated **release years** when missing, based on name and notes
- Suggested **mash bill composition** when not publicly available

✅ All AI-enhanced data was **manually reviewed and verified**.  
❌ No part of the Shiny app code, R functions, or UI layout was generated by AI.  
🧑‍💻 All programming and package development was done manually by Chris Reddish.
