## bourbonExplorer Overview

`bourbonExplorer` is a Shiny app designed to interactively explore bourbon attributes such as Price, ABV, Ratings, and more.

## Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("your-github-username/bourbonExplorer")

# AI Usage Disclosure

In accordance with course guidelines, I disclose that the `bourbonExplorer` package incorporated AI assistance during dataset enrichment. The OpenAI API (GPT-4) was utilized to:
- Generate concise flavor profiles for each bourbon entry
- Estimate release years when missing or unclear

All AI-generated content was manually verified before inclusion. No AI tools were used to write package code, Shiny app code, or documentation structure. All R programming, app development, and package packaging were completed by the author.
